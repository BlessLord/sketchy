solver and prototxt for training triplet network 

The prototxt file might be some capability issue with the lastest caffe since I was using an old version from last year

For triplet loss I was using the version here https://github.com/happynear/caffe-windows/blob/master/src/caffe/layers/triplet_loss_layer.cpp
